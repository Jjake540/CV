**A chef’s journey from pots and pans to bashing keyboards**

After spending 15 years working at some of London’s finest restaurants, I'm after a new challenge in software development! How did this come about? Well, during the pandemic I spent a fair amount of time on furlough, after getting bored of making sourdough a friend recommended giving coding a go - as I had no idea if I would still have a job to go back to. I’m enjoying this new challenge and it is great fun learning a new skill while being able to be creative and build my own projects. Wanting to turn this into more than just a hobby, I did my research and joined [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/).

| [Recipedia](https://recipedia-cbe2c.web.app/)/[Repo](https://github.com/Jjake540/Recipedia)/[Wiki](https://github.com/Jjake540/Recipedia/wiki)| Final project at Makers! A web app that lets you find recipes online, with additions to create and save your recipes. Created this project over 2 weeks, with no experience of React or Firebase, it was a steep learning curve but very proud of what we created. Check out the Wiki section to see a more in-depth description of what we did in the project. | React, Firebase - Authentication, Cloud Firestore, Hosting, Jest |
| [Acebook](http://limitless-atoll-12397.herokuapp.com/login)/[Repo](https://github.com/Jjake540/Acebook) | This was a group project where we created a clone of Facebook over 2 weeks and had our first interaction with a framework. Time for self-study was needed to get an understanding of Rails so we could best organise the project. Strong focus on teamwork to build on what was learnt during the first group project. | Ruby on Rails, Bootstrap, Heroku, Rspec, Capybara |
| [Bank Tech Test](https://github.com/Jjake540/bank-tech-test) | An example tech test, written in ruby to demonstrate TDD, OOP and clean code principles. | Ruby, Rspec |
| [MakersBnB](https://github.com/Jjake540/makersBnB) | Made a mini version of AirBnB in one week! This was the first group project at Makers. The main learnings were organisation and planning, using Trello to plan our days and all taking responsibility for scrum master during the week.  | Ruby, HTML, CSS, Sinatra, PostgresSQL, HTML, CSS, Rspec, Capybara |

## Work-Experience

#### Sous Chef at the Honourable Society of Lincolns Inn. London, July 2018 – August 2021.
- Spent one year leading the Banqueting team. Team of 4 chefs doing large prestigious events.
- Managed and mentored the junior chef’s.
- Worked closely with other departments to ensure the events ran smoothly.

**In my last two years I set up and opened a private members restaurant** - [The MCR restaurant](https://www.lincolnsinn.org.uk/members/the-mcr-restaurant-bar/)
- High levels of time management and planning are involved in the setting up of the restaurant. This led to a smooth opening of the restaurant with the standards increasing at a consistent level.
- Junior staff got promoted through my mentorship.
- Regular team meetings to help the team evolve and the business to grow. All staff were encouraged to bring ideas to the table on all aspects of the business.
- During the pandemic we had to change the business model to allow for a takeaway/delivery service.

#### Sous Chef at Duck and Waffle. London, July 2017 – July 2018. - [Duck & Waffle](https://duckandwaffle.com/)
- Supported the head chef with managing the kitchen and took the lead when he wasn’t available.

## Skills
#### Collaboration
I have always worked as a part of a team and have a great appreciation of teamwork and team success. Working and learning together is fundamental for the team and individual growth. I listen to team members expectations and ideas while taking ownership of my tasks. Collaborating while pair programming was a huge learning experience at Makers as I paired most days through the course. 
#### Communication
The key to any team’s success. At Makers, I’ve learnt about the Agile process, which is very similar to how I have worked in previous roles with regular meetings and discussions where all team members can share their ideas in an open discussion. During the group projects at Makers leading standups, retros, updating Trello boards and assigning tasks to my team members also helped give me a better understanding of leadership within a software development role.
#### Testing
In kitchens, tasting the food regularly and often is second nature to me. I find with coding the mindset of testing fits very well with this process so TDD felt like a natural progression. Recent process review screenshot below.

#### Initiative
Working in restaurants, taking initiative is crucial as things can change quickly and with little warning, where you are constantly having to think on your feet to find a solution. This has made me very adaptable and a quick thinker willing to put myself out there to find a solution to any situation.

Continuing with my coding after Makers by going through [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/user/jake-burton-stewart/) courses to build on my JavaScript knowledge, while also working on my projects, [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/Jjake540) and doing process reviews though Makers.
#### Problem Solving 
I’m developing a great understanding of the creative process involved in good programming, by figuring out solutions, thinking outside the box and isolating the issues. During the final project at Makers, deciding to use Firebase when a new version had recently been released was an interesting experience as 99% of the tutorials online were out of date so we had to dive deep into Firebase docs to find solutions to our problems, while also getting acquainted with a NoSQL database for the first time. I love the creativity involved in working through problems.
