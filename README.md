**A chef’s journey from pots and pans to coding**

After spending 15 years working some of London’s finest restaurants, I'm after a new challenge in software development! How did this come about? Well, during the pandemic I spent a fair amount of time on furlough, after getting bored of making sourdough a friend recommend giving coding a go - as I had no idea if I would still have a job to go back to. I’m really enjoying this new challenge and is great fun learning a new skill. Wanting to turn this into more than just a hobby, I did my research and joined [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/).

## Work-Experience

#### Honourable Society of Lincolns Inn. London
#### July 2018 – August 2021. Sous Chef
I spent my first year here running the Banqueting team. We did events from high-end fine dining dinners, canapé functions and weddings for up to 250 guests. With a team of 4 chefs including myself, organisation and team work was key to the success of these events. 
In my last two years I had the opportunity to set up, open and run the private members restaurant with just a small team of 5 in the kitchen.

#### Duck and Waffle. London
#### July 2017 – July 2018. Sous Chef
Duck and Waffle is a large operation and keeping everything running requires a lot of work and organisation. Open 24/7 serving around 1000 customers a day. My responsibilities were to help with the day to day running of the kitchen and be in-charge in the place of Head chef when he wasn’t available. Creating new dishes for the menu and assisting the production chef with updating our food costs, recipes and sourcing new suppliers.

## Skills
#### Collaboration
I have always worked as a part of a team and and have a great appreciation of team work and team success. Working and learning together is fundamental for team and individual growth. I listen to team members expectations and ideas while taking ownership for my own tasks.
#### Communication
The key to any team’s success. At Makers I’ve learnt about the Agile process, which is very similar to how I have worked in previous roles with regular meetings and discussions where all team members can share their ideas in an open discussion.  
#### Detail
Coming from a cooking background I have a strong attention to detail. I’ve found that creating code shares the same methodology as creating a recipe. This really helped my understanding of building code from the ground up.
#### Initiative
Working in restaurants taking initiative is crucial as things can change quickly and with little warning, were you are constantly having to think on your feet to find a solution.
